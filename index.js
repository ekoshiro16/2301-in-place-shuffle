/*
Write an in-place algorithm that takes an array of strings (where the array represents a deck of cards, and each string represents the name of a given card in the deck).

Your algorithm should return the input array, but with the cards shuffled in a random order. 

For example, you could be provided an array like:
['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
Where each string is a card from "Ace" to "King". 

Note: Remember that an in-place algorithm does NOT use any additional variables that use up more than constant space (i.e. O(1) space complexity). 
Note 2: Remember that you must modify the original input value in an in-place algorithm. 

WARNING: Be mindful that each card should have an equal chance to any other card to be shuffled into a given random location. Avoid shuffling cards more than once!
